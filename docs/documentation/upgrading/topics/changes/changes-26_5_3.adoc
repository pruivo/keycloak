=== `UserSessionProvider` API changes

The internal `UserSessionProvider` interface received new methods for efficient streaming of user sessions, in both speed and memory.
The streaming instances are read-only, meaning they will not change.
The previous methods have been deprecated.
Custom providers should implement these new methods to avoid performance penalties.
They should avoid keeping the returned items in memory by for example binding them to the current transaction, in case the invoker needs to analyze all data.

A similar change was done for the `UserSessionPersisterProvider`.
